# SomeContract README

## Overview

This README document provides details about `SomeContract`, a smart contract implemented in the Move programming language for the Move Virtual Machine (VM). `SomeContract` includes definitions for a struct named `SomeStruct`, a resource named `SomeResource`, and various functions.

### Struct: SomeStruct

#### Variables

- `a` (String): A variable that can be set publicly.
- `b` (String): A variable that is publicly accessible.
- `c` (String): A variable that is restricted to the contract.
- `d` (String): A variable that is restricted to the struct itself.

#### Functions

- `publicFunc()`: A public function accessible to all.
- `contractFunc()`: A function restricted to the contract.
- `privateFunc()`: A function restricted to the struct itself.
- `structFunc()`: A public function defined within the struct. (AREA 1)

The struct is initialized with default values for its variables in the contract's `init()` function.

### Resource: SomeResource

#### Variable

- `e` (Int): A publicly accessible variable.

#### Function

- `resourceFunc()`: A function associated with the resource. (AREA 2)

The resource is initialized with a default value in its `init()` function.

### Public Functions

- `createSomeResource()`: Creates and returns an instance of `SomeResource`.
- `questsAreFun()`: A public function for engaging in fun quests. (AREA 3)

### Main Module

The main module imports `SomeContract` from a specified address and includes a `main()` function. (AREA 4)

### How to Use

1. Deploy `SomeContract` on the Move VM.
2. Execute the contract's functions as needed:
   - Call `createSomeResource()` to instantiate `SomeResource`.
   - Use `questsAreFun()` to engage in quests.
   - Explore additional functionalities based on your requirements.

### Dependencies

This contract depends on the module `SomeContract` available at address `0x05`.
